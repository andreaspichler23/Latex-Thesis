.... from file *f in memory:

TFile *g = TFile::Open("/home/andreas/vip2/thesis/Latex/Figures/root/Histograms.root","UPDATE")

TH1F *hen = (TH1F*)f->Get("ht1")

//to check the list: f->GetList()->ls()
f->GetList()->Write()



..... from a TTree:

get the histo to memory with sthg like:
ts->Draw("SDDedeop>>hSddEdepCosm(250,50,3000)","SDDedeop>50") ... dont close the drawing of the histogram!!

for th2f: h->SetDirectory(0) necessary??? -> nope dont think so, but it might help
problem solve: also write the histogram to the file itself; then "Get" it and proceed like above -> this should help always

TFile *g = TFile::Open("/home/andreas/vip2/thesis/Latex/Figures/root/Histograms.root","UPDATE")

hSddEdepCosm->Draw() ... for testing

hSddEdepCosm->Write() ... Write("",TObject::kOverwrite) for overwriting



.... deleting histograms:

TFile *g = new TFile("Histograms.root","update")
g->Delete("hGammaEnDep;2")


error:
Error R__unzip_header: error in header (when you want to open it eg in Tbrowser)

save histogram in a completely new file and hadd this file to the root file where you want to save it
