scintillator + sipm detection ratio for cosmics (smi) and for 500 mev electrons (lnf test beam); background rejection at smi (tdc+qdc correlation) -> test of the functionality of the daq; sdd time resolution tests, sdd energy resolution determination (-> thereby also testing the cryogenics); tests with high current and water cooling;
