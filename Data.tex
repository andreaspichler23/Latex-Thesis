with data from lngs only, validation of the low rejection rate for gammas calculated first by simulations, problems with sipm noise, approximate cosmic rate at lngs; peak drift -> division of complete data set -> calibration of small files -> summation -> calibration, desription of calibration function and calibration procedure; slow control data: dependence of fwhm on: current, temperatures; the time with high rate?? -> probably better not; calculation of counts in roi -> standard analysis, bayesian count based analysis, bayesian gaussian fit analysis; calculation of beta
